## The Math Behind Approximating Pi

Let U<sub>1</sub> and U<sub>2</sub> be independent U(-1,1) random variables.

The probability that (U<sub>1</sub>, U<sub>2</sub>) is in the unit circle `C = { (x_1, x_2): x_1^2 + x_2^2 â‰¤ 1 }` is, you guessed it, around the value of Pi! The more samples you draw from the uniform distribution, the more accurate this estimate will be.
