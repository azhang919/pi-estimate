## The Math Behind Approximating Pi

Let U<sub>1</sub> and U<sub>2</sub> be independent U(-1,1) random variables.

The probability that (U<sub>1</sub>, U<sub>2</sub>) is in the unit circle C = { (x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>): x_1<sup>2</sup> + x_2<sup>2</sup> â‰¤ 1 } is around the value of Pi! The more samples you draw from the uniform distribution, the more accurate this estimate will be. Below is a graph visualization of 100,000 drawings of uniform RVs.
